      <p><strong></strong></p>

      <p>
        I worked as a Software QA Tester on the company’s flagship Internet Banking System project, a highly critical platform
        used by banking customers for online transactions, cheque management, fixed deposit (FD) handling, account monitoring,
        and financial reporting. Given the sensitive nature of banking applications, my role required a strong focus on accuracy,
        security, usability, and compliance with financial industry standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience allowed me to work in a fast-paced agile environment where quality assurance was not just about detecting defects,
        but also about contributing to a seamless, secure, and user-friendly banking experience.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Project Context & Scope</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensuring data integrity and accuracy across financial modules.</li>
        <li>Maintaining a consistent experience across browsers and devices.</li>
        <li>Supporting frequent releases in short sprint cycles without compromising stability.</li>
        <li>Meeting audit and compliance requirements demanded by financial regulators.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As a QA tester, I was deeply involved from requirement analysis through release sign-off, ensuring full coverage and traceability of test cases.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Core Responsibilities</h3>

      <h4>1. Test Design & Execution</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Translated functional and business requirements into detailed test cases.</li>
        <li>Created manual test scenarios for functional, regression, smoke, and integration testing.</li>
        <li>Maintained a requirement traceability matrix (RTM) using Excel to ensure test coverage.</li>
        <li>Conducted data-driven testing for transaction workflows (different account types, currencies, transaction limits, etc.).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>2. Defect Tracking & Quality Metrics</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Logged issues into JIRA, categorized by severity and priority.</li>
        <li>Conducted root cause analysis discussions with developers to identify recurring issues.</li>
        <li>Maintained a defect density chart for each release cycle to measure product stability.</li>
        <li>Ensured defects were resolved within the sprint and re-tested in subsequent builds.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>3. Test Automation Development</h4>
      <p>I designed and maintained an automation framework tailored for banking workflows:</p>
      <p><strong>Tools/Tech Stack:</strong> Selenium WebDriver, Java, TestNG, Maven, Jenkins.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Page Object Model (POM) for better script maintainability.</li>
        <li>Data-driven testing using TestNG annotations and external test data files.</li>
        <li>Parallel test execution to speed up regression runs.</li>
        <li>Customized ExtentReports integration for execution logs, screenshots, and audit-ready HTML reports.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Automated workflows included:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>User login & session management.</li>
        <li>Fund transfers and transaction confirmation.</li>
        <li>FD creation, maturity, and closure.</li>
        <li>Cheque request and status validation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The automation framework reduced manual regression effort by ~40%, ensuring quicker release validation.</p>

      <h4>4. API & Backend Validation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Performed REST API testing using Postman.</li>
        <li>Validated APIs for account balances, transaction history, FD creation, and cheque status.</li>
        <li>Ensured frontend and backend data consistency by comparing API responses with UI outputs.</li>
        <li>Designed positive, negative, and boundary test cases for API endpoints.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>5. Cross-Browser & Mobile Testing</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Tested the application across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.</li>
        <li>Performed responsive testing for mobile devices to ensure compatibility with Android and iOS browsers.</li>
        <li>Verified UI/UX consistency and usability across platforms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>6. Agile Process & Collaboration</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Participated in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospective meetings.</li>
        <li>Worked closely with developers to clarify requirements and reproduce bugs.</li>
        <li>Supported User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with clients, guiding them through test execution and documenting feedback.</li>
        <li>Contributed to test planning, sprint reports, and release notes for stakeholders.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>7. CI/CD Integration</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Configured Jenkins pipelines to trigger test automation runs after each code commit.</li>
        <li>Implemented nightly regression test runs with automated reporting.</li>
        <li>Ensured quick feedback loops for developers, supporting continuous integration practices.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Key Achievements</h3>
